#### Data Sources 
- HPD Housing Litigations [Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Litigations/59kj-x8nc)

- HPD Lead Violations [Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/LEAD-VIOLATIONS/up7n-jfw5/data)

#### Methodology 

##### Summary & Intention
As required under state law, only 50% of NYC’s toddlers are being tested for lead. Therefore, the NYC Council is putting in place more protections for these vulnerable children. Now, 80% of NYC's children under three are being tested at least once.

The data team analyzed local law 57 data in order to:
- Conduct analysis on the presence of lead paint violations and litigations in NYC over time 
- Identify areas in NYC where lead paint violations and litigation are particularly prevalent

#### Main Takeaways
- Upper Manhattan and the Bronx are the areas with the greatest number of lead violations and litigations. As of March 2023, 45% of all lead-related court cases in New York City were in the Bronx.
- The Bronx and Upper Manhattan had the most HPD lead litigation cases between 2006 and March 2023. Since 2006, District 14 in the Bronx has filed more than 500 litigation cases.
- City-wide, Staten Island and Queens have the fewest HPD lead-based paint violations and lead litigations.

#### Recommendations
A traunch of bills was passed previously to address lead paint in NYC Homes that:
- Require the investigation and remediation of lead hazards in spaces where children routinely spend 10 hours or more/week. [Read the Bill: Int 464-B](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3343772&GUID=D826FA06-E66A-4ECD-BBF1-B30F7BE3C3C2&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=464)
