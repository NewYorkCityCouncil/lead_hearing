# lead paint city council worst CDs

The average number of lead paint violations per 1000 bbls across NYC is X

Lead paint violations have remained consistently above average in the following council districts.

BBLs that have repeatedly failed to remediate lead-paint violations are 

```{r}
hmcv_sub <- fread("data/lead_data_hmcv_4_11_23.csv")
hmcv_sub[, inspectiondate := as.Date(inspectiondate)]
hmcv_sub[, yearinspect := year(inspectiondate)]

# check nas
hmcv_sub[streetname %in% "FOREST AVENUE" & housenumber %in% "861", councildistrict :=  49]
hmcv_sub[streetname %in% "BEACH 88 STREET", councildistrict :=  32]
hmcv_sub[streetname %in% "GRAND CENTRAL PARKWAY SOUTH", councildistrict :=  24]
hmcv_sub[streetname %in% "ADAM CLAYTONPOWELL JR BOULEVARD", councildistrict :=  9]

lead_paint <- hmcv_sub[grep("SECTION 27-2056.6", novdescription, ignore.case = TRUE), .(violationid, inspectiondate, CounDist=councildistrict, yearinspect)]

# get pluto info re number of bbls in a cd

pluto_file <- fread("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/64uk-42ks.csv?$limit=99999999") 

pluto_sub <- pluto_file[unitsres > 0, .(
    bbl = str_sub(as.character(bbl), 1, 10),
    CounDist = council)]

bbls_cd <- unique(pluto_sub[, .N, by = .(CounDist)])
lead_paint_sub <- unique(lead_paint[yearinspect >= 2020, ])
lead_paint_sub[, vios_cd := length(unique(violationid)), by = .(CounDist)]

lead_map <- unique(merge(lead_paint_sub[ ,.(CounDist, vios_cd, yearinspect)], bbls_cd))
